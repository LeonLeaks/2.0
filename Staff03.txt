[2017-03-26 14:23:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I wonder if I can just watch and take notes [Face with tears of joy]

[2017-03-26 14:24:04] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Oh ok

[2017-03-26 14:24:17] <Rhett [Zestia]> There is probably a google dork to find plists lol
[2017-03-26 14:24:24] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:24:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> That's everyone here...
[2017-03-26 14:24:54] <Josh [Zestia]> Almost everyone here
[2017-03-26 14:24:59] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I wonder if I can update the plist files on my phone
[2017-03-26 14:25:05] <Rhett [Zestia]> No
[2017-03-26 14:25:07] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> wait I have an idea.
[2017-03-26 14:25:08] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Nah
[2017-03-26 14:25:14] <Ahmad S.| UW> Qu√©
[2017-03-26 14:25:19] <Ahmad S.| UW> Brb
[2017-03-26 14:25:23] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> We make a google drive acct for the plist files only
[2017-03-26 14:25:23] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Would be cool though. Easy to update files straight from our phones
[2017-03-26 14:25:44] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> like a team account everyone uses for that purpose
[2017-03-26 14:25:45] <Rhett [Zestia]> I guess you could if you can edit .txt on it online somewhere
[2017-03-26 14:25:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> You don't need Xcode just a text editor
[2017-03-26 14:25:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> You can
[2017-03-26 14:26:07] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> yh I thought so
[2017-03-26 14:26:10] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Like the documents app?
[2017-03-26 14:26:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> Probably will as long as you can save as .plist
[2017-03-26 14:26:29] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yh
[2017-03-26 14:26:36] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Can save as anything
[2017-03-26 14:26:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I'll send the link
[2017-03-26 14:26:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> But I don't think you can upload to database with phone
[2017-03-26 14:27:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait so are we basically converting IPA to plist?
[2017-03-26 14:27:07] <Rhett [Zestia]> No
[2017-03-26 14:27:08] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Documents 5 - File manager, PDF reader and browser by Readdle Inc.
https://appsto.re/us/Vw_Vv.i
[2017-03-26 14:27:24] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And yeah you can Upload to google drive
[2017-03-26 14:27:25] <Rhett [Zestia]> They already have one signed we are just linking it to our plists
[2017-03-26 14:27:26] <Ahmad S.| UW> Documents5 in nice
[2017-03-26 14:27:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah Rhett I don't think that's possible...maybe...But if that's the case and we can't we can just convert on here and send them to one person to do it all at once
[2017-03-26 14:27:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I'll test it once he shows us
[2017-03-26 14:27:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah
[2017-03-26 14:27:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I have the app downloaded
[2017-03-26 14:27:54] <Ahmad S.| UW> Same^
[2017-03-26 14:27:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Same same
[2017-03-26 14:28:01] <Ahmad S.| UW> Have had it forever
[2017-03-26 14:28:09] <Rhett [Zestia]> Honestly I bet you can through Dropbox app
[2017-03-26 14:28:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Probably
[2017-03-26 14:28:18] <Ahmad S.| UW> But gimme 15 minutes and ill have access to a computer
[2017-03-26 14:28:23] <Ahmad S.| UW> Gotta take a shower
[2017-03-26 14:28:31] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But the only problem would be uploading it..which isn't possible..I don't think
[2017-03-26 14:28:40] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Google Drive
[2017-03-26 14:28:42] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Google Drive
[2017-03-26 14:28:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> I bet you can. You usually can through online drives
[2017-03-26 14:28:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> Such as Dropbox and Google
[2017-03-26 14:29:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes Rhett but how would that upload to the app?
[2017-03-26 14:30:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> What do you mean? It's just the database. It will have an upload button. Then you can probably click through google drive or something
[2017-03-26 14:30:21] <Rhett [Zestia]> That's how I do it with my signed
[2017-03-26 14:30:21] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yh
[2017-03-26 14:30:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> *signer
[2017-03-26 14:30:36] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> didn't joe sign your apps rhett[Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:30:46] <Rhett [Zestia]> No I use his GitHub tho
[2017-03-26 14:30:56] <Rhett [Zestia]> I don't have to rely on people to sign my own shit
[2017-03-26 14:30:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So Rhett what your saying is:

We make the .plist in the documents app and then we import that to google drive. In google drive there's just a fucking button that says upload to app?

[Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:31:06] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> No
[2017-03-26 14:31:11] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> You upload to the database
[2017-03-26 14:31:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Lmfao
[2017-03-26 14:31:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> This is confusing me...
[2017-03-26 14:31:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> No. within the database you can upload
[2017-03-26 14:31:19] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Someone saves the file to the pc
[2017-03-26 14:31:22] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Ok?
[2017-03-26 14:31:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> Don't worry. Leon will explain
[2017-03-26 14:31:27] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Then they upload tot he DB
[2017-03-26 14:31:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And don't we need a computer to aces the database?
[2017-03-26 14:31:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Access*
[2017-03-26 14:31:36] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yh I think we do
[2017-03-26 14:31:39] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Maybe not
[2017-03-26 14:31:41] <Rhett [Zestia]> Probably not
[2017-03-26 14:31:52] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Bc I need to fix my laptop [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:32:05] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> How would that be possible to upload a file from iOS to the Zestia database?
[2017-03-26 14:32:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Expressionless face] Dylan [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:32:24] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> IM NOT THAT SMART WITH THIS SHIT [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:32:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> Save it via Dropbox. Go to database. Click upload. Click from Dropbox.
[2017-03-26 14:32:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> The database is accessible from iOS? Hows that?
[2017-03-26 14:32:56] <Josh [Zestia]> I'll just do it on my MacBook to save confusion[Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:33:06] <Rhett [Zestia]> But this will be a shitty operation because we will have to do it all the time since the apps will probably get revoked daily
[2017-03-26 14:33:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's just a website you can upload from dylan
[2017-03-26 14:33:28] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok that makes sense now
[2017-03-26 14:33:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I can fix all apps daily...I got plenty of time at night
[2017-03-26 14:34:04] <Rhett [Zestia]> You guys all understand plists, correct?
[2017-03-26 14:34:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> One thing I have to say
[2017-03-26 14:34:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck no [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-26 14:34:21] <Rhett [Zestia]> Okay then [Face with tears of joy]

[2017-03-26 14:34:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Sure

[2017-03-26 14:35:09] <Rhett [Zestia]> I don't even talk to joe anymore
[2017-03-26 14:35:12] <Josh [Zestia]> I don't know what a plist is either
[2017-03-26 14:35:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett send me and josh a plist so we can learn from it
[2017-03-26 14:35:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> Ah fuck okay. Someone make a learning group so I don't have to share to everyone

[2017-03-26 19:08:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Can you just send a video of you altering any IPA so I can see how it's done? Start from the beginning to end
[2017-03-26 19:10:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Not IPA, .plist
[2017-03-26 19:11:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> Ill just make a video damnit
[2017-03-26 19:11:35] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy] Ok den
[2017-03-26 19:19:36] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ca is a piece. Of. Shit.
[2017-03-26 19:19:55] <Ahmad S.| UW> Wat
[2017-03-26 19:20:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Nothing
[2017-03-26 19:20:05] <Ahmad S.| UW> K
[2017-03-26 19:21:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> Ca is fucking bullshit
[2017-03-26 19:21:39] <Ahmad S.| UW> Wat
[2017-03-26 19:21:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes dylan
[2017-03-26 19:22:15] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Is so unorganized for one
[2017-03-26 19:22:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett hmu if you manage to get a video...don't worry though. It's fucking annoyingly shitty
[2017-03-26 19:25:56] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's hard to manage something used by millions with an iPhone
[2017-03-26 19:27:39] <Rhett [Zestia]> It is just so hard and time consuming I think we are better off not using mobile
[2017-03-26 19:27:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> K
[2017-03-26 19:28:16] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Still gonna try to figure it out though...I could do it on the go instead of bringing my laptop with me
[2017-03-26 19:28:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yea
[2017-03-26 19:28:45] <Rhett [Zestia]> It probably can be done with a paid code editor
[2017-03-26 19:29:00] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I understand how to do it I just don't understand how you get this:

itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://aiir.xyz/PLIST/gba4ios.plist
[2017-03-26 19:29:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I got money. Any editor you think could work?
[2017-03-26 19:29:23] <Ahmad S.| UW> Video?
[2017-03-26 19:31:05] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett can you just explain how to get that short link into the whole edit part?
[2017-03-26 19:31:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> Just put the itms-services part in front of the plist link. I usually just copy and paste it ahead of the plist link
[2017-03-26 19:31:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> It is
[2017-03-26 19:31:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=
[2017-03-26 19:32:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://aiir.xyz/PLIST/gba4ios.plist
[2017-03-26 19:32:03] <Rhett [Zestia]> Just save that in your notes or something
[2017-03-26 19:32:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes but then how do I rename?
[2017-03-26 19:32:21] <Rhett [Zestia]> That works
[2017-03-26 19:32:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh
[2017-03-26 19:32:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> The installation name?
[2017-03-26 19:32:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes. Isn't that what we need to change?
[2017-03-26 19:33:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes. That is the 3rd thing to change in the plist. It's below the Bundle ID
[2017-03-26 19:33:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> It will say that name. Just edit it and upload to GitHub
[2017-03-26 19:33:37] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But I don't see bundle I'd or anything...I just see itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://aiir.xyz/PLIST/gba4ios.plist
[2017-03-26 19:34:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> After he itms- part is the plist link (the clickable part)
[2017-03-26 19:34:17] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes
[2017-03-26 19:34:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ohhhh copy and paste the link to github?
[2017-03-26 19:34:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Or the code editor?
[2017-03-26 19:34:42] <Rhett [Zestia]> No
[2017-03-26 19:34:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck
[2017-03-26 19:34:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> When you click the plist link you see that .ipa link, right?
[2017-03-26 19:35:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> You see that?
[2017-03-26 19:35:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes
[2017-03-26 19:35:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> You fill that link in on the plist template I uploaded to GitHub/Dropbox.
[2017-03-26 19:35:41] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok
[2017-03-26 19:35:46] <Rhett [Zestia]> Also see on that page the com.something.somehing?
[2017-03-26 19:35:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> Fill that in for the bundle ID
[2017-03-26 19:36:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Umm...no.
[2017-03-26 19:36:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh yes

[2017-03-27 09:02:28] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I have 2 cats and I saved a mouse.
[2017-03-27 09:02:29] <Leon M'laiel> Nah I usually watch my cat catch em
[2017-03-27 09:02:51] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I did for 15 min and I decided it was time to save him

[2017-03-27 09:03:34] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Was it bad that I saved him?
[2017-03-27 09:31:10] <Mazen> Why would it be bad
[2017-03-27 09:31:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Because it's a wild animal
[2017-03-27 09:31:55] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And I could contract a disease
[2017-03-27 09:32:06] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> but I'm risking that so I can keep him safe

[2017-03-27 15:13:46] <Leon M'laiel> Only hacked games
[2017-03-27 15:13:55] <Leon M'laiel> Because hacked games get automatically updated

[2017-03-27 19:14:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Do you mind if I remove it and fix it?
[2017-03-27 19:14:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes Leon
[2017-03-27 19:14:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> It works on JB devices
[2017-03-27 19:14:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> And non JB

[2017-03-27 19:15:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Idk what's wrong with it...
[2017-03-27 19:15:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> What's it doing?
[2017-03-27 19:16:23] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Just says can't connect
[2017-03-27 19:18:46] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh. The itms link?
[2017-03-27 19:19:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fixed it
[2017-03-27 19:21:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> What was it
[2017-03-27 19:21:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Idk. Just completely re did the whole thing
[2017-03-27 19:22:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh. Ok
[2017-03-27 19:23:19] <„Ö§> Hey you guys want help I can get the plists I just need to know what apps
[2017-03-27 19:23:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> Tell me if this is a good idea or now
[2017-03-27 19:23:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> *not
[2017-03-27 19:23:43] <„Ö§> Ok
[2017-03-27 19:24:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> So...since we are using plists now there is a high chance they won't work most the time. It would be great if there was a button next to the download one that says "Report as down". Then we will know what's up and what's down.
[2017-03-27 19:24:44] <Leon M'laiel> On it
[2017-03-27 19:24:48] <„Ö§> Yea and it could be like a mailto:ZESTIAS-EMAIL
[2017-03-27 19:24:52] <„Ö§> The button
[2017-03-27 19:24:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> Thanks dad ;)
[2017-03-27 19:25:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> No mail.
[2017-03-27 19:25:13] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Just added channels app
[2017-03-27 19:25:14] <„Ö§> The button mailto:ZESTIAS-EMAIL OR TWITTER
[2017-03-27 19:25:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> That would be too much I think
[2017-03-27 19:25:21] <„Ö§> Twitter?
[2017-03-27 19:25:40] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> No cause if it's mail that will be even more spam because people just click the button
[2017-03-27 19:25:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> Just a simple "report button". Just a link we can go to and see what has been reported
[2017-03-27 19:25:46] <„Ö§> Ok
[2017-03-27 19:25:53] <Leon M'laiel> That's more complicated than a simple mail
[2017-03-27 19:26:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> No it's not
[2017-03-27 19:26:11] <„Ö§> Maybe google forums?
[2017-03-27 19:26:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Can you make a seperate mail from the support and make it so they can't see the mail it's being sent to?
[2017-03-27 19:26:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> A place we can see what has been reported instead of like 10372933 emails a day
[2017-03-27 19:26:45] <Leon M'laiel> Then you code that place
[2017-03-27 19:26:45] <„Ö§> What about google forums?
[2017-03-27 19:26:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> MIRDON
[2017-03-27 19:27:04] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Mirdon ain't here
[2017-03-27 19:27:07] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yea. Like google forms

[2017-03-27 19:48:35] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Just showing you why one of those buttons are a bad idea..
[2017-03-27 19:48:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Maybe we set a limit. A person can only report an app so many number of times
[2017-03-27 19:55:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yea. Like 1 report per app per day
[2017-03-27 19:56:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> 1 per user
[2017-03-27 19:56:50] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We all know it's all gonna be "SNAp CHat WoNT cOnNeCT!"
[2017-03-27 20:07:06] <Rhett [Zestia]> Actually.....SC Phantom works fine

[2017-03-30 18:56:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So just updating the apps will be simple
[2017-03-30 18:56:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Are these apps on Zestia rn?

[2017-04-01 09:01:36] <Leon M'laiel> 99% doesn't even work
[2017-04-01 09:01:44] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Lmfao
[2017-04-01 09:01:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Shet
[2017-04-01 09:01:50] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Hi Leon
[2017-04-01 09:02:05] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Is it 3pm there Leon?
[2017-04-01 09:02:19] <Leon M'laiel> Yes
[2017-04-01 09:02:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh leon did rhett tell you what happened last night?
[2017-04-01 09:02:34] <Leon M'laiel> Nope
[2017-04-01 09:03:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Well we kind lost all the apps on zestia. They just disappeared and we didn't touch them. Rhett got them back. Thought you should know in case it's a big
[2017-04-01 09:03:07] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Bug*
[2017-04-01 09:03:31] <Leon M'laiel> How did they disappear?
[2017-04-01 09:04:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> It just showed the legend and didn't show any apps. They just weren't in the app. They were all in the js file though
[2017-04-01 09:05:04] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I knew when I added sc phantom the only thing I would hear would be about connection error
[2017-04-01 09:05:28] <Leon M'laiel> Probably because someone here who added an app forgot the backslashes
[2017-04-01 09:05:34] <Leon M'laiel> \
[2017-04-01 09:05:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ah maybe. Rhett and I were the only ones last night so I probably forgot...
[2017-04-01 09:06:19] <Leon M'laiel> You have to add a backslash to every line because.. JavaScript sucks
[2017-04-01 09:06:31] <Leon M'laiel> SC Phantom world through [Relieved face]
[2017-04-01 09:06:38] <Leon M'laiel> Works**
[2017-04-01 09:06:39] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I was up till 3am wtf why didn't you ask me
[2017-04-01 09:06:45] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Dylan
[2017-04-01 09:06:47] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I was surprised it did....
[2017-04-01 09:07:00] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> But the connection error [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:07:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Cause kylin this was an emergency and we didnt want leon beating us [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:07:07] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> K
[2017-04-01 09:07:16] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Leon is hot when he's mad [Face throwing a kiss]
[2017-04-01 09:07:18] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:07:24] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Well....
[2017-04-01 09:07:58] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:08:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Gonna add movie box in a little bit...
[2017-04-01 09:08:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon have you found a fix to requiring tutu?
[2017-04-01 09:08:45] <Leon M'laiel> Maybe.. linking tutu
[2017-04-01 09:08:48] <Leon M'laiel> As a crash fix
[2017-04-01 09:08:53] <Leon M'laiel> That's what Tweakbox does
[2017-04-01 09:09:04] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> we need to find what causes it
[2017-04-01 09:09:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok
[2017-04-01 09:09:55] <Leon M'laiel> I thought maybe making an app with the same identifier would fix but but the thing is - We'd have to sign it
[2017-04-01 09:09:59] <Leon M'laiel> Enterprise sign it
[2017-04-01 09:10:02] <Leon M'laiel> Lmfaoo no thanks
[2017-04-01 09:10:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> An that's expensive af....
[2017-04-01 09:10:24] <Leon M'laiel> Then I thought about a profile with the same identifier
[2017-04-01 09:10:32] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But?
[2017-04-01 09:10:35] <Leon M'laiel> But profiles use profile identifiers and not bundle identifiers rip
[2017-04-01 09:10:41] <Leon M'laiel> So it doesn't make a difference
[2017-04-01 09:10:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Hmm....
[2017-04-01 09:10:57] <Leon M'laiel> That means we will have to link tutu..
[2017-04-01 09:11:08] <Leon M'laiel> But I don't  want users  to go on the site
[2017-04-01 09:11:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Nobody wants to install a shady Chinese app
[2017-04-01 09:11:18] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:11:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And we should be kinda independent from them. It's better...
[2017-04-01 09:11:30] <Leon M'laiel> That's why I'll link tutu's PLIST directly
[2017-04-01 09:11:35] <Leon M'laiel> Only as a crash fix
[2017-04-01 09:11:43] <Leon M'laiel> They do not have to open the app or anything
[2017-04-01 09:11:57] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> They will just need the app?
[2017-04-01 09:11:57] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Did you hear about the drama last night with them?
[2017-04-01 09:12:15] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They tweeted they'd block all people affiliated with zestia [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 09:12:26] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And they weren't lying...
[2017-04-01 09:12:37] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Really?
[2017-04-01 09:12:41] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They didn't block me
[2017-04-01 09:12:50] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And I have zestia team IN MY NAME
[2017-04-01 09:12:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'm blocked by them. So is rhett...

[2017-04-01 13:14:44] <Mazen> Aha

[2017-04-01 13:21:43] <Mazen> Yeah okay ready
[2017-04-01 13:23:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> Okay Mazen. So if you look in the js file copy 1 paragraph of code and paste below a \. Make sure that code has \ above and below. Then just change the info in that JavaScript (plist, icon name, etc)
[2017-04-01 13:28:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Mazen make a pastebin and show is first before you upload
[2017-04-01 13:48:26] <Mazen> Where is the GitHub
[2017-04-01 13:50:13] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Bruh
[2017-04-01 13:50:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Maybe we leave the app updatjng to me and to 
Rhett? [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 13:53:27] <Mazen> ;-;
[2017-04-01 13:55:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yea, honestly not that it's hard but more like if everyone edits it there could end up with issues. I'd rather leon be in my ass then you guys
[2017-04-01 13:55:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> But if you feel like you really want to then I'm not gonna stop you. If you want then you got this

[2017-04-01 15:54:03] <Kylin> What
[2017-04-01 15:54:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> icydia uses a different certificate
[2017-04-01 15:54:15] <Leon M'laiel> Take apps from there then
[2017-04-01 15:54:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I am
[2017-04-01 15:54:37] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What apps that we have currently require tutu?
[2017-04-01 15:54:39] <Kylin> What is it
[2017-04-01 15:54:53] <Kylin> ICydia?
[2017-04-01 15:54:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> yes
[2017-04-01 15:55:13] <Leon M'laiel> Check if the apps work tho
[2017-04-01 15:58:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> They do
[2017-04-01 15:58:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Should I replace them now?
[2017-04-01 15:59:00] <Leon M'laiel> Only if they work 100%
[2017-04-01 15:59:05] <Kylin> Where do I get the apps
[2017-04-01 15:59:09] <Kylin> Like the links
[2017-04-01 15:59:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait...they use the same ones as tutu but they don't require tutu...as far as I can tell.
[2017-04-01 16:00:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Kylin
[2017-04-01 16:00:06] <Leon M'laiel> Did you delete tutu?
[2017-04-01 16:00:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah one sec

[2017-04-01 16:00:20] <Kylin> Damn
[2017-04-01 16:00:28] <Kylin> I'll hit him up and see how he did that
[2017-04-01 16:00:31] <Kylin> If
[2017-04-01 16:00:42] <Leon M'laiel> Don't
[2017-04-01 16:00:49] <Leon M'laiel> Just take em [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-01 16:01:01] <Leon M'laiel> Tell me which app you replaced so I can test them as well
[2017-04-01 16:01:05] <Kylin> Kek
[2017-04-01 16:01:08] <Kylin> wait
[2017-04-01 16:01:13] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok I'll replace it in a min if it works
[2017-04-01 16:01:16] <Kylin> You got that message?!
[2017-04-01 16:01:27] <Kylin> The one that said sigh
[2017-04-01 16:01:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck
[2017-04-01 16:01:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck fuck fuck
[2017-04-01 16:01:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Requires tutu....
[2017-04-01 16:06:45] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok we gotta figure out how to steal from tweakbox
[2017-04-01 16:07:13] <Leon M'laiel> TweakBox also requires tutu
[2017-04-01 16:07:15] <Kylin> I'll get tweakbox
[2017-04-01 16:07:17] <Kylin> Ok?
[2017-04-01 16:07:21] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Dammit
[2017-04-01 16:07:33] <Kylin> Not the paid apps tbh
[2017-04-01 16:07:41] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Is there anybody else that signs apps?
[2017-04-01 16:07:48] <Kylin> Um
[2017-04-01 16:07:55] <Kylin> I just found out...
[2017-04-01 16:08:03] <Rhett [Zestia]> I would
[2017-04-01 16:08:03] <Kylin> We've been stealing. From VSHARE
[2017-04-01 16:08:09] <Rhett [Zestia]> I just need to get a DUNS
[2017-04-01 16:08:15] <Leon M'laiel> Nope
[2017-04-01 16:08:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> I technically own a business
[2017-04-01 16:08:18] <Kylin> Yeah
[2017-04-01 16:08:19] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett doesn't it cost lots of $
[2017-04-01 16:08:23] <Kylin> hold on
[2017-04-01 16:08:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> $300
[2017-04-01 16:08:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> Per account
[2017-04-01 16:08:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So basically every revoke is -300
[2017-04-01 16:08:43] <Leon M'laiel> Does that mean Enterprise signed apps?
[2017-04-01 16:08:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> ?
[2017-04-01 16:08:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yep
[2017-04-01 16:08:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> But if it's revoked the whole account is
[2017-04-01 16:08:56] <Leon M'laiel> But tbh we can't afford that
[2017-04-01 16:08:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett...that's not worth it.
[2017-04-01 16:09:05] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes it is
[2017-04-01 16:09:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> If we get a lot of customers
[2017-04-01 16:09:12] <Rhett [Zestia]> Like tutu
[2017-04-01 16:09:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Where are we gonna afford $300 every 2 weeks?
[2017-04-01 16:09:29] <Leon M'laiel> Don't ask me how Tutu affords this shit
[2017-04-01 16:09:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> ...well
[2017-04-01 16:09:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Tutu is a bigger company
[2017-04-01 16:09:41] <Rhett [Zestia]> Tutu has a lot of business
[2017-04-01 16:09:48] <Leon M'laiel> Do they have ads?
[2017-04-01 16:09:52] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes
[2017-04-01 16:10:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But we already told the public no ads
[2017-04-01 16:10:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> On free version
[2017-04-01 16:10:12] <Rhett [Zestia]> I gtg tho
[2017-04-01 16:10:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> I'm working
[2017-04-01 16:10:16] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Cya
[2017-04-01 16:10:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> I'll be back later
[2017-04-01 16:10:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What if we redirected all hacked app installs through a tinyurl with ads?
[2017-04-01 16:11:02] <Kylin> I mean
[2017-04-01 16:11:07] <Kylin> it's possible
[2017-04-01 16:11:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> It would be a bit annoying but it would bring in some money...
[2017-04-01 16:11:27] <Kylin> I'll set up an adf.ly acct
[2017-04-01 16:11:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon the only other alternative I can see is bumping up Appsicle prices or placing ads
[2017-04-01 16:12:05] <Kylin> yh
[2017-04-01 16:12:07] <Kylin> maybe
[2017-04-01 16:12:22] <Kylin> Using AdSense or Ad Services
[2017-04-01 16:12:50] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ads and maybe bumping up Appsicle prices a bit? What if we also put ads on ZA impactor?
[2017-04-01 16:12:55] <Kylin> No
[2017-04-01 16:13:03] <Kylin> not bumping up prices
[2017-04-01 16:13:11] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Whys that?
[2017-04-01 16:14:11] <Kylin> Because it has to say cheaper than a popsicle somewhat
[2017-04-01 16:14:38] <Kylin> I type this all with my nose
[2017-04-01 16:15:07] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Let's assume 200 people have bough Appsicle so far. Let's say it costs $3.99 to buy and $2.99 to sign people. Thats already $200 made.
[2017-04-01 16:15:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> If we bumped the prices up $1 we would have enough.
[2017-04-01 16:15:48] <Kylin> And it cost 699 for lifetime
[2017-04-01 16:16:00] <Kylin> With 100 people bought that we already have $6900
[2017-04-01 16:16:38] <Kylin> In all we would've made $6600
[2017-04-01 16:17:13] <Kylin> On the business end of things if you charge us tax and if he charges fees for different countries gs it would probably be different
[2017-04-01 16:17:40] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> With that and a little ads we would have enough to last a year with revokes every 2 weeks
[2017-04-01 16:17:47] <Kylin> I mean you do have to put in consideration that he does sign the stuff himself but he does have to manage and he has to have some money for himself though he's gonna pay the bills and feed himself if you know
[2017-04-01 16:17:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> True
[2017-04-01 16:18:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So let's say Leon takes half
[2017-04-01 16:18:37] <Kylin> But yeah you're right we would have quite a bit of money so we could afford those revokes but we would have to continuously renew and water for account get suspended we'd spend another hundred bucks
[2017-04-01 16:18:55] <Kylin> Sorry I'm doing this with dictation I'm too lazy to type
[2017-04-01 16:19:31] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So assuming Leon takes about 3,400 per 200 lifetime Appsicle orders we would still have enough to last us about 6 months. Imagine 200 orders every 3 weeks. We get tons.
[2017-04-01 16:19:36] <Kylin> But then you got a consideration people who would get refunds after they got the app and he can't really unsigned the app so we would lose money there if I remember how PayPal works unless they patched it of course
[2017-04-01 16:19:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Then he says no refund
[2017-04-01 16:20:29] <Kylin> Of course we could all have developer accounts and it would be easier if one account gets suspended we use another
[2017-04-01 16:20:39] <Kylin> Right?
[2017-04-01 16:20:46] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> That would cost shit tons, correct?
[2017-04-01 16:20:56] <Kylin> Each of us having a developer account?
[2017-04-01 16:21:11] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes. I don't know this program very well.
[2017-04-01 16:21:28] <Kylin> Well if it's $300 for an enterprise account we could each have one so that would count Leon you me Josh and wrecked so that would be quite a bit
[2017-04-01 16:21:41] <Kylin> Rgett*
[2017-04-01 16:21:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ahh I get it. With an enterprise account we get developer accounts under the one account?
[2017-04-01 16:22:12] <Kylin> So $1500 for all of us but wouldn't it be worth it?
[2017-04-01 16:22:56] <Kylin> The developer account is less features than the enterprise account so in money turns yes you would but you would also have extra feature so pretty much get more bang for your buck right?
[2017-04-01 16:23:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Well it would but what happens when 10 weeks (estimated time for 5 accounts to get revoked) are up? We would spend another 1,500?
[2017-04-01 16:23:04] <Kylin> Man this dictation is pretty good LMAO
[2017-04-01 16:23:47] <Kylin> Well with about 100 people order it then that would be if they bought lifetime of course that would be another so what if Leon took at least 1000 out of it we still at least have 5500
[2017-04-01 16:24:15] <Kylin> Sometimes when I use with the dictation I stutter so sometimes won't make sense
[2017-04-01 16:24:31] <Kylin> Mostly because I'm shy LOL
[2017-04-01 16:24:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes but Leon needs more than $1000
[2017-04-01 16:24:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> At least $3000 to cover basic needs
[2017-04-01 16:25:32] <Kylin> So say he did get half would still have enough to pay for two terms of enterpriseaccount
[2017-04-01 16:25:35] <Kylin> so
[2017-04-01 16:25:45] <Kylin> We'd be good for 2-3 months.
[2017-04-01 16:25:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett and Leon
[2017-04-01 16:26:08] <Kylin> And the 3000 would be per month
[2017-04-01 16:26:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok. When you see Leon or I see him I'll explain all this to him
[2017-04-01 16:26:18] <Kylin> Ok
[2017-04-01 16:40:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> What???
[2017-04-01 16:57:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Basically if 200 people buy appsicle lifetime a month then we will be able to afford enterprise ceryificsyes.
[2017-04-01 16:57:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Certificates*
[2017-04-01 17:05:38] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes but it's actually getting it that's the hard part
[2017-04-01 17:06:11] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Why
[2017-04-01 17:08:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> You have to get a DUNS number. Plus you have to register as a legitimate business
[2017-04-01 17:08:36] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Can you do that?
[2017-04-01 17:15:43] <Leon M'laiel> Scrap that idea
[2017-04-01 17:16:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So what we do then?
[2017-04-01 17:38:54] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Leon we were just dreaming of a business that will never have

[2017-04-01 19:13:46] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Doesn't vShare require you to have vShare for their vShare apps to work?
[2017-04-01 19:13:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> http://www.vshare.com

[2017-04-01 19:16:07] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> You can get all the ipas from them you want. None will work unless they're signed.
[2017-04-01 19:16:39] <Rhett [Zestia]> I think that it's UDID signing with vshare :/
[2017-04-01 19:16:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> It. Is.
[2017-04-01 19:17:17] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Nobody besides tutu signs enterprise apps. It's the reality.
[2017-04-01 19:17:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I say our best bet is to just add tutu as a crash fix
[2017-04-01 19:28:50] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'm gonna do it. Temporary crash fix until we get it done
[2017-04-01 19:30:43] <Rhett [Zestia]> Why don't we make it so if you install spirit it automatically installs tutu also?
[2017-04-01 19:30:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> *Spotify
[2017-04-01 19:33:35] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Just spotify?
[2017-04-01 19:36:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'll just add it called crash fix and then make it have the Zestia icon. We won't be giving tutu any customers but we will be helping ours
[2017-04-01 20:06:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett I think I know how to automate all ++ but I need your help

[2017-04-01 22:42:58] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> What is it
[2017-04-01 22:43:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> I made a dummy app, same bundle-ID as tutu. Spotify just checks to see if you have it.
[2017-04-01 22:43:36] <Rhett [Zestia]> Then when u install Spotify it downloads that app too
[2017-04-01 22:43:48] <Kylin> Wow ur smarter than I thought.

[2017-04-01 23:34:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Thx
[2017-04-01 23:34:15] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ye
[2017-04-01 23:34:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> So..
[2017-04-01 23:34:27] <Rhett [Zestia]> My idea will kinda work
[2017-04-01 23:34:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> ?
[2017-04-01 23:34:35] <Rhett [Zestia]> But I have found some issues
[2017-04-01 23:34:45] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What idea
[2017-04-01 23:34:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> The dummy app
[2017-04-01 23:35:04] <Rhett [Zestia]> For Spotify and stuff
[2017-04-01 23:35:05] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What?
[2017-04-01 23:35:17] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh it downloads with Spotify?
[2017-04-01 23:35:21] <Rhett [Zestia]> Omg. How it will make Spotify think it's installed
[2017-04-01 23:35:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> But here's the issues...
[2017-04-01 23:35:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We can't
[2017-04-01 23:35:41] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes we can
[2017-04-01 23:35:45] <Rhett [Zestia]> Totally possible
[2017-04-01 23:35:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> But.
[2017-04-01 23:36:00] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But?
[2017-04-01 23:36:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> 1. Even if I have this "dummy" app how will they install? It's gonna be signed.
2. it doesn't check for bundle ID. It checks for URL Scheme
[2017-04-01 23:36:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> It isn't worth the trouble. People can just install regular until we can figure out a better method
[2017-04-01 23:37:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> It is worth the trouble. This could be a permanent fix
[2017-04-01 23:37:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok....so how do we fix these problems?
[2017-04-01 23:38:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> I'm working on it
[2017-04-01 23:38:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> I'm working on #2
[2017-04-01 23:38:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> Idek about #1
[2017-04-01 23:38:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok. I can help you in the morning. Tired af

[2017-04-02 02:32:27] <Leon M'laiel> Morning guys
[2017-04-02 02:32:43] <Leon M'laiel> Rhett, just saw your crash fix, proud of you, good job!
[2017-04-02 03:39:27] <Mazen> Hi
[2017-04-02 04:06:48] <Mazen> Where is the github link me bb
[2017-04-02 04:07:32] <Mazen> Ty
[2017-04-02 09:13:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Thanks Leon!
[2017-04-02 09:13:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> What Mazen
[2017-04-02 09:13:28] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett that link makes it so we don't need tutu?
[2017-04-02 09:14:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yep
[2017-04-02 09:14:24] <Leon M'laiel> It downloads tutu tho [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:15:00] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So...how do we add it?
[2017-04-02 09:15:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> No it doesn't
[2017-04-02 09:15:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh....so what's the difference between that and the crash fix I uploaded last night?
[2017-04-02 09:15:43] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's a fake app with the name TutuHelper. You can change the name
[2017-04-02 09:15:53] <Rhett [Zestia]> The crash fix on GitHub doesn't work
[2017-04-02 09:16:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait tutu seriously just made it so you need the name TutuHelper?
[2017-04-02 09:16:17] <Rhett [Zestia]> I uploaded the Xcode project in that link you can change the name or whatever
[2017-04-02 09:16:33] <Rhett [Zestia]> No they made it so you have to have their URL Scheme
[2017-04-02 09:16:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> But I fixed that using a dummy app
[2017-04-02 09:16:49] <Leon M'laiel> I mean the crash fix on Zestia is only tutu
[2017-04-02 09:16:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok so let's upload it!
[2017-04-02 09:16:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh yes
[2017-04-02 09:16:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> We can't dylan
[2017-04-02 09:17:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's not signed
[2017-04-02 09:17:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah I know Leon. I wanted to do something to fix it temperorly
[2017-04-02 09:17:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait why Rhett
[2017-04-02 09:17:13] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ahh....
[2017-04-02 09:17:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So...we're fucked again?
[2017-04-02 09:17:21] <Leon M'laiel> $300 enterprise cert lmfao
[2017-04-02 09:17:27] <Rhett [Zestia]> RIP
[2017-04-02 09:17:46] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Hmm....
[2017-04-02 09:18:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> Unless we can convince them to upload it to their thing because it makes Spotify++ "go faster" or some shit [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:19:07] <Rhett [Zestia]> Wait Leon
[2017-04-02 09:19:09] <Rhett [Zestia]> I have an idea
[2017-04-02 09:19:45] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett that wouldn't work [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:19:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> I have an idea
[2017-04-02 09:20:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh cool. Don't tell me the idea. Just say you have one [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:21:00] <Rhett [Zestia]> Now I'm not skilled like Leon with this sorta thing so idk if it's possible. If it's possible to put that URL Scheme in a web clip application we are unfucked. Oh and fuck you dylan.
[2017-04-02 09:21:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> That sounds possible....Leon is it?
[2017-04-02 09:21:34] <Leon M'laiel> What URL scheme
[2017-04-02 09:21:35] <Leon M'laiel> Tf
[2017-04-02 09:21:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Tutus
[2017-04-02 09:22:08] <Leon M'laiel> Don't tutus apps simply check if the Tutu Application ID is installed?
[2017-04-02 09:22:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's tutus URL scheme. It's what the other apps check for. If the other apps see it then it launches it
[2017-04-02 09:22:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> And no it doesn't
[2017-04-02 09:22:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> Already tried
[2017-04-02 09:22:30] <Leon M'laiel> Explain that to me
[2017-04-02 09:22:39] <Rhett [Zestia]> Explain what [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:22:50] <Leon M'laiel> URL scheme..????
[2017-04-02 09:22:53] <Rhett [Zestia]> I already tried that leon, it checks for URL scheme
[2017-04-02 09:23:22] <Leon M'laiel> What is a bloody URL scheme
[2017-04-02 09:23:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh. It's a small part in the plist. It's like 4 lines I added toward the bottom. If those apps check for that and if it doesn't have it it dies plays the popup. It just basically tricks iOS that it's tutu
[2017-04-02 09:23:55] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> The moment when Rhett outsmarts Leon....
[2017-04-02 09:24:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:24:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> For once lol
[2017-04-02 09:24:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's in the info.plist Leon
[2017-04-02 09:24:32] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett why not just remove all this mambo jumbo from the scheme?
[2017-04-02 09:24:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> Remove it? [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:24:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fucking delete it
[2017-04-02 09:25:10] <Leon M'laiel> Wait a second
[2017-04-02 09:25:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> That code that looks for it is in their applications they sign. We can't delete that in their apps
[2017-04-02 09:25:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> Dylan.
[2017-04-02 09:25:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> You dumbfuck [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:25:29] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> IDFK [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:25:46] <Leon M'laiel> That means you basically add a line of code to an Info.plist and all tutu apps think it's tutu and launch?
[2017-04-02 09:26:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Exactly
[2017-04-02 09:26:19] <Rhett [Zestia]> I add it to the info.plist in the dummy app
[2017-04-02 09:26:41] <Rhett [Zestia]> The app doesn't even have to work, it just has to actually install
[2017-04-02 09:26:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But we're back to square 1. We need either a signed dummy app or a web clip
[2017-04-02 09:26:53] <Rhett [Zestia]> Exactly
[2017-04-02 09:27:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> And I don't think webclip uses info.plist
[2017-04-02 09:27:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'm just saying if we get this done we cannot tell people what it's really doing. If people find out it's bypassing tutu then tutu will find out and block us out again.
[2017-04-02 09:27:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> They can't block shit with me around dylan [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:27:59] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I mean they'll patch it somehow
[2017-04-02 09:28:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> Maybe
[2017-04-02 09:28:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And if they do it'll be harder to crack than this one. Not worth the extra trouble.
[2017-04-02 09:29:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> If you guys wanna change the name from tutuapp to "Fixer" or something you can. The Xcode project is in that folder I uploaded
[2017-04-02 09:29:42] <Rhett [Zestia]> People underestimate me [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:29:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> I remember when I hacked that kid so hard
[2017-04-02 09:30:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> Poor kid
[2017-04-02 09:31:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Does the crash fix I uploaded last night do anything?
[2017-04-02 09:31:12] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett
[2017-04-02 09:31:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> What? Just he TUTU app? [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:31:31] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Changing its name won't help. It's useless if it isn't signed, correct?
[2017-04-02 09:31:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> YES IT IS TUTU BUT LETS NOT CALL IT THAT [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:31:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes but it won't have tutu in the name anymore lol
[2017-04-02 09:32:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> No. I mean the fixer.
[2017-04-02 09:32:11] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's called turuapp on the appname rn
[2017-04-02 09:32:17] <Rhett [Zestia]> I said you guys can change it to whatever
[2017-04-02 09:32:40] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok Rhett if I open the project, name it fixed, and upload fixer to Zestia, when people install it will be tutu but will be named fixer?
[2017-04-02 09:32:56] <Rhett [Zestia]> No. I made the fixer app bro
[2017-04-02 09:33:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> It is not tutu at all
[2017-04-02 09:33:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> Did you even download the app I made? [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:33:28] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> NO
[2017-04-02 09:33:32] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> How?
[2017-04-02 09:33:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> Sideload it for now
[2017-04-02 09:34:10] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck dat shit [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:34:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Face with tears of joy] just use Impactor
[2017-04-02 09:34:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Don't got time for dat. I'm no even home rn so...
[2017-04-02 09:34:45] <Rhett [Zestia]> It works, but it was late and I forgot to change the app name
[2017-04-02 09:34:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> Okay
[2017-04-02 09:35:21] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett if we were to sign the fix what are the odds it gets revoked?
[2017-04-02 09:35:47] <Rhett [Zestia]> Sign with a regular dev account? [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:35:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/848529413411147779/848529407480385536/Pwu4jVIl.jpg
[2017-04-02 09:35:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> There she is
[2017-04-02 09:36:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok so say we sign it. What are odds it gets revoked?
[2017-04-02 09:36:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> Sign it via UDID?
[2017-04-02 09:36:30] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Sign via dev
[2017-04-02 09:36:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Publicly
[2017-04-02 09:36:40] <Rhett [Zestia]> So Enterprise?
[2017-04-02 09:36:41] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Enterprise certificate
[2017-04-02 09:36:46] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes
[2017-04-02 09:37:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> Umm...I mean..I'm sure it will get revoked but not as fast as tutu would get theirs revoked I'm sure
[2017-04-02 09:37:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> Where is Leon [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:37:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Idk...stupid idea. Can't even get a dev account to begin with
[2017-04-02 09:38:16] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Or not a dev account, an enterprise certificate
[2017-04-02 09:38:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's completely possible if we buy from 3rd parties like tutu
[2017-04-02 09:38:35] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon?
[2017-04-02 09:38:40] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok so what's a 3rd party besides tutu?
[2017-04-02 09:39:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Heck if I know. If I knew I would already have an enterprise account lol
[2017-04-02 09:40:26] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Exactly. Nobody in the world of jailbreak alternatives are signing anything (besides tutu)
[2017-04-02 09:40:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Unless you wanna call target and ask for their enterprise certificate but....
[2017-04-02 09:41:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> That's what I'm saying. We buy our own
[2017-04-02 09:41:07] <Rhett [Zestia]> But from 3rd parties
[2017-04-02 09:41:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Name one and I'll contact them asap
[2017-04-02 09:41:34] <Rhett [Zestia]> "Heck if I know. If I knew I would already have an enterprise account lol"
[2017-04-02 09:41:44] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Mm
[2017-04-02 09:41:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> Dude
[2017-04-02 09:41:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> Did you see my app?
[2017-04-02 09:42:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> Be that way cunt
[2017-04-02 09:42:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> FUCKING IDEA
[2017-04-02 09:42:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> Go ahead dylan [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:43:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok so assuming ZA impactor is gonna happen, why not just tell everyone to sign it themselves via ZA?
[2017-04-02 09:43:15] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rite?
[2017-04-02 09:43:55] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> RITE I AM
[2017-04-02 09:44:08] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett send me your wallpaper
[2017-04-02 09:44:08] <Rhett [Zestia]> Umm....
[2017-04-02 09:44:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> Maybe that will work
[2017-04-02 09:44:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> But it's probably only going to be 7 day signing
[2017-04-02 09:44:37] <Rhett [Zestia]> So they gotta do it every 7 days
[2017-04-02 09:44:37] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> So?
[2017-04-02 09:44:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> People resign every 7 days
[2017-04-02 09:44:46] <Rhett [Zestia]> HELL NO
[2017-04-02 09:44:47] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> No biggie
[2017-04-02 09:44:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> ACTUALLY
[2017-04-02 09:44:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> WUT
[2017-04-02 09:44:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> We don't even need to do it every 7 days
[2017-04-02 09:45:05] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's a dummy app. It doesn't need to open
[2017-04-02 09:45:11] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> True!
[2017-04-02 09:45:11] <Rhett [Zestia]> 1 install will work [Face with tears of joy][Face with tears of joy][Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 09:45:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> YAY
[2017-04-02 09:45:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> SO HOW WE DO THAT?
[2017-04-02 09:45:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> ZA Impactor
[2017-04-02 09:45:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Right
[2017-04-02 09:45:39] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok send me your wallpaper pls

[2017-04-02 09:46:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> There
[2017-04-02 09:46:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Thanks again
[2017-04-02 09:46:45] <Rhett [Zestia]> LEON!
[2017-04-02 09:46:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> WE MUST SHARE OUR IDEAS WITH YOU
[2017-04-02 09:47:15] <Leon M'laiel> What's up
[2017-04-02 09:47:23] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We got some good ones
[2017-04-02 09:47:30] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We use ZA Impactor to sign Rhett's app
[2017-04-02 09:47:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Everybody signs the app and they only need to do it once. Once it's there, Zestia works.
[2017-04-02 09:48:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes. The app only needs it signed once since it's not made to open
[2017-04-02 09:48:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> So tell people to install my app first then the other apps
[2017-04-02 09:48:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> And we don't ever need to resign it since it doesn't open anyway
[2017-04-02 09:49:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> This is the best fucking idea I ever had bro
[2017-04-02 09:49:26] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> CAUSE I THOUGHT OF IT U FEG
[2017-04-02 09:49:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> No you didn't cunt

[2017-04-02 11:48:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> What the fuck
[2017-04-02 11:48:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> When I upload it to GitHub it gets messed up
[2017-04-02 11:49:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> Nevermind. It just wasn't loading on my Mac I guess
[2017-04-02 11:53:01] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon said ZA Impactor won't be done for months...
[2017-04-02 11:56:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> Damnit. We have another problem
[2017-04-02 11:57:24] <Rhett [Zestia]> If ZA I isn't webclip then that would have to be signed too! [Loudly crying face][Loudly crying face][Loudly crying face]
[2017-04-02 12:01:26] <Leon M'laiel> ZAI can sign itself
[2017-04-02 12:07:50] <Mazen> Where is the github omg
[2017-04-02 12:11:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh okay.
[2017-04-02 12:12:11] <Rhett [Zestia]> Mazen you need what GitHub link? Plists?
[2017-04-02 12:14:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett why don't we just make the fix a We clip?
[2017-04-02 12:14:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Web*
[2017-04-02 12:15:22] <Leon M'laiel> Because Webclips do not have info.plist's
[2017-04-02 12:15:25] <Leon M'laiel> They're profiles
[2017-04-02 12:15:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ahh
[2017-04-02 12:15:39] <Leon M'laiel> But is it possible to implement the URL scheme into a profile?
[2017-04-02 12:15:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'll look around for someone who can sign the app...
[2017-04-02 12:16:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon
[2017-04-02 12:16:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> Ummm
[2017-04-02 12:16:33] <Rhett [Zestia]> Actually maybe
[2017-04-02 12:16:37] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Could we maybe partner with say ipwnstore or something and Idk, we advertise for them in exchange for them signing our app...?
[2017-04-02 12:16:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Cause I think they sign public too
[2017-04-02 12:16:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> No I don't think so. UDID.
[2017-04-02 12:17:05] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But I think they CAN sign publicly
[2017-04-02 12:17:11] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Hold up lemme ask them
[2017-04-02 12:17:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon..can you include info.plists in profiles???

[2017-04-02 16:14:03] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's because it's not signed
[2017-04-02 16:14:27] <Rhett [Zestia]> We have to wait on them to resign it
[2017-04-02 16:14:33] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok

[2017-04-02 17:31:00] <Rhett [Zestia]> I shouldn't have even made that
[2017-04-02 17:31:03] <Rhett [Zestia]> We will never use it
[2017-04-02 17:31:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We can if we can get someone to sign it...
[2017-04-02 17:31:31] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Let's ask tutu for one [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:31:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Face with tears of joy] I know what we could do
[2017-04-02 17:31:57] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I do to...
[2017-04-02 17:32:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We use Joe as a Trojan horse!
[2017-04-02 17:32:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> He says he has a new app and wants to upload it, and he does upload it, bit inside is the crash fix
[2017-04-02 17:32:28] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:33:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> Dude
[2017-04-02 17:33:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> I was just about to ducking say that
[2017-04-02 17:33:34] <Rhett [Zestia]> My phone crashes and had to restart
[2017-04-02 17:33:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Well guess I was quicker [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:33:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> Like I swear...did I tell you that idea earlier?
[2017-04-02 17:34:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> No....
[2017-04-02 17:34:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> I was gonna say that...like word by word
[2017-04-02 17:34:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:34:22] <Leon M'laiel> I'm working on two other JS files, one for the About page
[2017-04-02 17:34:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yay
[2017-04-02 17:34:33] <Rhett [Zestia]> Thank you

[2017-04-02 17:34:40] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Aye aye
[2017-04-02 17:34:46] <Rhett [Zestia]> Give us one for team members too [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:35:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Should we create a separate section in about labeled council or no?
[2017-04-02 17:35:36] <Leon M'laiel> Nah
[2017-04-02 17:35:42] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok
[2017-04-02 17:36:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Any apps we should add? I'm literately just sitting in tutu looking for apps to steal
[2017-04-02 17:36:11] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon, do you think we will ever use my app?
[2017-04-02 17:36:21] <Rhett [Zestia]> I know dylan
[2017-04-02 17:37:03] <Leon M'laiel> If I get together $300 so we can sign it, yes!
[2017-04-02 17:37:25] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Hmm...
[2017-04-02 17:37:29] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ads
[2017-04-02 17:37:32] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Appsicle
[2017-04-02 17:37:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> YouTube fundraisers?
[2017-04-02 17:37:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> Eh...
[2017-04-02 17:37:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Idk
[2017-04-02 17:37:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> Even if we get $300 it's so hard
[2017-04-02 17:38:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> The
[2017-04-02 17:38:36] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> True*
[2017-04-02 17:42:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> I found my fix...
[2017-04-02 17:43:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok guys
[2017-04-02 17:43:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait who do you mean?
[2017-04-02 17:44:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Explain Rhett but also someone test this before I upload
[2017-04-02 17:44:05] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZestiaIPAS/plists/master/pstouch.plist
[2017-04-02 17:44:43] <Rhett [Zestia]> Well...I talked to joe
[2017-04-02 17:44:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And?
[2017-04-02 17:45:23] <Rhett [Zestia]> He said he will put it in the next PixlRec update submitted to tutu
[2017-04-02 17:45:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> But...
[2017-04-02 17:45:29] <Rhett [Zestia]> There is an issue
[2017-04-02 17:45:32] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck yes
[2017-04-02 17:45:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Issue?
[2017-04-02 17:45:49] <Rhett [Zestia]> You must have tutu installed to install PixlRec
[2017-04-02 17:46:01] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fuck
[2017-04-02 17:46:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Wait no we don't
[2017-04-02 17:46:28] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> No no no we don't
[2017-04-02 17:46:41] <Rhett [Zestia]> What
[2017-04-02 17:46:47] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> If they upload it and we steal it as long as the app is there it will work, correct?
[2017-04-02 17:46:59] <Rhett [Zestia]> Oh dang
[2017-04-02 17:47:06] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes!
[2017-04-02 17:48:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> This is gonna work
[2017-04-02 17:49:07] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes o yes it will!!!!
[2017-04-02 17:49:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/848653600444252163/848653589794795520/CHszA7jL.jpg
[2017-04-02 17:49:35] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> ASAP
[2017-04-02 17:50:11] <Rhett [Zestia]> This will so work bro
[2017-04-02 17:50:13] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Fucking idiots at tutu aren't even gonna know [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:50:30] <Rhett [Zestia]> Exactly
[2017-04-02 17:50:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> And if they don't know how we're bypassing it they won't know what to fix
[2017-04-02 17:50:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon
[2017-04-02 17:50:55] <Rhett [Zestia]> This is gonna be great
[2017-04-02 17:50:57] <Leon M'laiel> It should install just fine [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:51:12] <Leon M'laiel> Oh my god
[2017-04-02 17:51:14] <Leon M'laiel> If this works
[2017-04-02 17:51:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon..I told joe payment will be issued
[2017-04-02 17:51:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> This is a huge risk
[2017-04-02 17:51:24] <Leon M'laiel> How much
[2017-04-02 17:51:33] <Leon M'laiel> I don't wanna go over 30
[2017-04-02 17:51:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We can be known as fuckin savages if this works
[2017-04-02 17:51:35] <Rhett [Zestia]> I told him to push the update and we will work from there
[2017-04-02 17:51:44] <Leon M'laiel> Alright..
[2017-04-02 17:51:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> If Joe gets caught though....his whole reputation with tutu is on the line
[2017-04-02 17:51:53] <Rhett [Zestia]> This was a great idea
[2017-04-02 17:52:10] <Leon M'laiel> How should Tutu know
[2017-04-02 17:52:10] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Once again, my idea [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:52:16] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Well...kinda
[2017-04-02 17:52:23] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Tutu wouldn't know.
[2017-04-02 17:52:39] <Leon M'laiel> They're too busy designing apps
[2017-04-02 17:52:43] <Leon M'laiel> Resigning *
[2017-04-02 17:52:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But if they realize we're telling people in our app to install pixel rec first they would know
[2017-04-02 17:52:52] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> But honestly they aren't gonna check Zestia
[2017-04-02 17:52:57] <Rhett [Zestia]> Tutu adds ads to all apps uploaded. This is a problem bc they can see the plist changes but..they have no reason to look in there so it should be okay
[2017-04-02 17:53:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Exactly. They aren't gonna know what much of it means anyway. Just gonna assume it's part of PixlRec
[2017-04-02 17:53:56] <Rhett [Zestia]> But PixlRec won't work without TutuHelper so I guess we tell them to install and it won't work or something [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:53:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> Idek
[2017-04-02 17:54:39] <Leon M'laiel> Look..
[2017-04-02 17:54:51] <Leon M'laiel> Installing an app works fine without a fix
[2017-04-02 17:54:54] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We just tell people in our app we partnered with PixlRec or some bullshit and they need PixlRec to run our apps
[2017-04-02 17:54:55] <Leon M'laiel> Only starting them needs a fix
[2017-04-02 17:55:03] <Leon M'laiel> If you download the fix via Tutu
[2017-04-02 17:55:09] <Leon M'laiel> You download it. You don't need to run it
[2017-04-02 17:55:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> They won't download the fix via tutu
[2017-04-02 17:55:18] <Leon M'laiel> That means it works fine as long as it's signed with tutu
[2017-04-02 17:55:29] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Oh that's true
[2017-04-02 17:55:30] <Leon M'laiel> They won't?
[2017-04-02 17:55:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> ...this is great
[2017-04-02 17:55:47] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> The fix is gonna be downloaded in Zestia but stolen from tutu
[2017-04-02 17:55:49] <Leon M'laiel> Wait what if we make Joe's App the fix?
[2017-04-02 17:55:55] <Leon M'laiel> Gives him promotion and we got a fix
[2017-04-02 17:55:59] <Leon M'laiel> Wait that's a bad idea
[2017-04-02 17:56:03] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We are Leon [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:56:09] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> That's the whole idea [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 17:56:14] <Rhett [Zestia]> That will let people use tutu tho
[2017-04-02 17:56:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> Not good
[2017-04-02 17:56:20] <Leon M'laiel> How?
[2017-04-02 17:56:24] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> That's why we don't use tutu
[2017-04-02 17:56:36] <Leon M'laiel> You don't use tutu, we link the PLIST
[2017-04-02 17:56:37] <Rhett [Zestia]> Joes app as a fix is what we are doing lol
[2017-04-02 17:56:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon Joe agreed to hide it within the app in the next update
[2017-04-02 17:56:45] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Within PixilRec
[2017-04-02 17:56:58] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah I know Leon
[2017-04-02 17:57:01] <Leon M'laiel> Tell Joe I wanna talk to him
[2017-04-02 17:57:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> How text? Twitter?
[2017-04-02 17:57:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> I didn't tell him this is for zestia
[2017-04-02 17:57:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> I said I need him to
[2017-04-02 17:57:32] <Leon M'laiel> Oh alright
[2017-04-02 17:57:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok basically what we're doing is using PixelRec as a Trojan horse. It looks fine but inside is the fix. We steal PixelRec from tutu like any other app but PixelRec is the fix
[2017-04-02 17:57:50] <Leon M'laiel> But he'll get questions on why the fix is his app
[2017-04-02 17:58:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> Nah he doI ant use zestia
[2017-04-02 17:58:11] <Leon M'laiel> People will hit him up
[2017-04-02 17:58:17] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Saying what?
[2017-04-02 17:58:28] <Leon M'laiel> "Why is your app a fix on Zestia"
[2017-04-02 17:58:31] <Rhett [Zestia]> Leon, he trusts me. He won't do something that makes me mad
[2017-04-02 17:58:37] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'm sorry but half of Zestia users aren't aware of the community
[2017-04-02 17:58:37] <Rhett [Zestia]> He won't get mad
[2017-04-02 17:58:44] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon that's the point
[2017-04-02 17:58:47] <Leon M'laiel> But the whole thing gives his app promotion.
[2017-04-02 17:58:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> So
[2017-04-02 17:58:53] <Leon M'laiel> So he should know?
[2017-04-02 17:58:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> I told him it would
[2017-04-02 17:59:00] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> We don't tell the users PixelRec is the fix. We just say it needs to be downloaded
[2017-04-02 17:59:16] <Leon M'laiel> When is it online?
[2017-04-02 17:59:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes

[2017-04-02 18:00:07] <Rhett [Zestia]> He said he will push the update soon
[2017-04-02 18:00:19] <Leon M'laiel> Hopefully soon is really soon
[2017-04-02 18:00:23] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> I'll think of some bullshit idea of why users need PixelRec to make Zestia work
[2017-04-02 18:00:27] <Leon M'laiel> Oh and Rhett can you update the fix icon on Zestia?
[2017-04-02 18:00:33] <Leon M'laiel> With the cool one you made today [Smiling face with smiling eyes]
[2017-04-02 18:00:37] <Rhett [Zestia]> Uh..sure [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 18:00:42] <Rhett [Zestia]> It took like 5 mins to make
[2017-04-02 18:00:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> Lol
[2017-04-02 18:00:51] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yeah Rhett I said that last night while I was uploading the fix
[2017-04-02 18:00:53] <Leon M'laiel> Lmfao I love it anyways
[2017-04-02 18:01:12] <Rhett [Zestia]> This is actually gonna work guys
[2017-04-02 18:01:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Hopefully
[2017-04-02 18:01:18] <Rhett [Zestia]> If it does this will be fucking amazing
[2017-04-02 18:01:55] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What if the reason is something really bullshit like the airplay in PixelRec is like activating Zestia OTA download
[2017-04-02 18:02:07] <Leon M'laiel> I'm also very close to the developer of AeroTV
[2017-04-02 18:02:20] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> What are the odds of him helping us out?
[2017-04-02 18:02:23] <Leon M'laiel> If Joe doesn't wanna do it I can ask Raufy and he'll do it
[2017-04-02 18:02:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> He will do it. Joe likes money
[2017-04-02 18:02:35] <Rhett [Zestia]> No matter how much
[2017-04-02 18:02:43] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> True
[2017-04-02 18:02:45] <Leon M'laiel> I'm working on AeroMusic with him so he should do it [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-02 18:03:00] <Rhett [Zestia]> We could do both in case one is revoked
[2017-04-02 18:03:10] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett
[2017-04-02 18:03:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> What
[2017-04-02 18:03:15] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Have you tested your fix works?
[2017-04-02 18:03:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yes it does
[2017-04-02 18:03:27] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's not signed tho
[2017-04-02 18:03:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok
[2017-04-02 18:04:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> Updated icon...just waiting for app to update

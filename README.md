# LeonLeaks 2.1
### *Zestia is not what it seems*

## Disclaimer

This inforamtion has been provided as a service of the community because of the shady actions of Leon. As a result, **do not witchhunt anyone involved in the leak, including Leon, Rhett, or anyone listed in the credits below**. This includes doxxing, DDoSing, hacking, etc.

## Thesis

Leon is a manipulative devloper in the iOS Community.

His fans have been brainwashed into thinking he's a good guy when this is far from the truth.

His so called free tweaks (which he has claimed are signed by him in the past) are actually from
TuTuHelper, a FREE service, which offers a wide variety of tweaks and apps. To crack down on people
stealing and claiming there signed tweaks, they made it so the user must have there application installed.
However once Leon and his team noticed this they decided to release a fix with there name on it and told their
followers not to open the app as it's malicious (which it's not, as far as we know). If this is the case then why would he be distributing their apps?

## Group Chats

Now to his group chats (he has multiple for multiple "parts" of Zestia). This is the most manipulative and scummy place on Twitter.

A hardcore Cynostial fan and Zestia "Dev" (Who probably can't code and only knows how-to steal some plists") named Rhett was asked if he should be using TuTu's tweaks as that's stealing. He replied saying that he doesn't care and thinks that nobody will find out anyway. Well we did.

We linked to the DMs below, as with other parts of this leak

You should know WeApp is TuTu.
NOTE: HE SHOWS HOW-TO STEAL FROM TUTU WHO HE CLAIMS TO BE FRIENDS WITH.

This is done with user agent checks.)

## Appsicle

Appsicle is most likely a scam. So far nobody is known with Appsicle access but Leon, despite his updates on it. If you want, [search up "Bought Appsicle" on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=Bought%20Appsicle).

## Trojan Claims

Proof of Zestia planning to inject viruses into apps, or (more likely) as a way to not require TuTu:

```
[2017-04-02 17:57:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok basically what we're doing is using PixelRec as a Trojan horse. It looks fine but inside
   is the fix. We steal PixelRec from tutu like any other app but PixelRec is the fix 
[2017-04-02 17:57:50] <Leon M'laiel> But he'll get questions on why the fix is his app 
[2017-04-02 17:58:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> Nah he doI ant use zestia
```

## ZestiaIPAS/plists Repo

**All of the images, DMs, and more from the various chat members are in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LeonLeaks/2.0) for easy viewing. They have DDoS threats, Leon congratulates them on stealing, and more.**

The DMs were extracted using DMArchiver, an open-source DM extractor.

## Fake Giveaways

Note: He has done fake giveaways for iPhone 7's in the past where he made users click ads on his site as many times as he could.

This is against the advertiser's ToC and is considered fraud.

[2017-03-18 12:13:14] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> It could be fake still. He can spoof the iOS version using Filza or iFile.
[2017-03-18 12:13:17] <ㅤ> I say it's real but he might wait to release it
[2017-03-18 12:13:20] <ㅤ> Ik you can

[2017-03-18 12:13:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> True. He never shows the iOS version UNjailbroken and rebooted
[2017-03-18 12:13:59] <ㅤ> He's not going to show any files or a video because exploits are hard to find
[2017-03-18 12:14:04] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Doing that resets all changed made
[2017-03-18 12:14:20] <Leon M'laiel> I call bullshit on that one, every single person, including Luca showed in depth proof
[2017-03-18 12:14:34] <Leon M'laiel> LOL he doesn't have to show the exploits in the video?
[2017-03-18 12:14:47] <Leon M'laiel> Just the device it self and proof of concept? Like lmfao this is so fake

[2017-03-18 12:15:16] <Leon M'laiel> Rip everyone who falls for this. If it'd be real, he would've covered it more in depth
[2017-03-18 12:15:22] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I mean, what does showing the files have to do with exploits.
[2017-03-18 12:15:35] <Leon M'laiel> Like Luca literally showed off with unreleased JB's in 10000 videos
[2017-03-18 12:15:46] <Leon M'laiel> I don't wanna see files I wanna see that it's a legit JB

[2017-03-20 19:33:23] <Leon M'laiel> Ruining a stream dedicated to Logan is honestly too much. Flooding me with hate over something dumb is one thing, this is something else.

[2017-03-22 19:58:27] <Amir[Zestia Support]> I don't like when people call me a terrorist. So does that mean when I'm around Arabs I'm gonna be calling them terrorists?
[2017-03-22 19:58:35] <Amir[Zestia Support]> That's the logic blacks have
[2017-03-22 19:58:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Nigga is friend, buddy, homie

[2017-03-23 07:17:17] <Mazen> Wait wait. So because there are Arab Terrorists it means Arabs are terrorists ?

[2017-03-23 18:56:52] <Leon M'laiel> Idk I love Sony but the PSV had so much potential
[2017-03-23 18:56:58] <Leon M'laiel> And they totally screwed it up

[2017-03-23 18:59:49] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They really ruined the modding community with PS4
[2017-03-23 19:00:01] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> PS3 was so much more free and customizable
[2017-03-23 19:00:01] <Leon M'laiel> Nah I think it's good

[2017-03-23 19:01:19] <Leon M'laiel> You can't even login to the PSN in 1.76
[2017-03-23 19:01:27] <Leon M'laiel> Maybe 3 years ago but definitely not now

[2017-03-24 13:10:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> If Leon is kicked they should be banned
[2017-03-24 13:10:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> Permanently
[2017-03-24 13:10:16] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Yes.

[2017-03-24 13:10:26] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Guess what

[2017-03-24 13:10:33] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> It's been 3 weeks ;)
[2017-03-24 13:10:40] <Josh [Zestia]> What?

[2017-03-24 13:11:02] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Kylin that's not up to me. It's Leon's decision
[2017-03-24 13:11:07] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon and the councils.
[2017-03-24 13:11:14] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I know that I'm just telling you
[2017-03-24 13:11:22] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ah ok
[2017-03-24 13:12:05] <Rhett [Zestia]> No way to see who it was tho
[2017-03-24 13:12:29] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yes there is
[2017-03-24 13:12:42] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Go to the "View People" option
[2017-03-24 13:12:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And see who isn't following you
[2017-03-24 13:12:52] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Still waiting  for the ok to try to remove the inactive members
[2017-03-24 13:12:58] <Rhett [Zestia]> I did
[2017-03-24 13:13:09] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I thought we did that once council started
[2017-03-24 13:13:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's just George that isn't following me and I'm not back
[2017-03-24 13:13:17] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Remember the "24 Hr Reply" thing?
[2017-03-24 13:13:21] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Rhett i don't wanna ask Leon until you agree but you think it's a good idea to kick people who don't  do anything such as George?
[2017-03-24 13:13:27] <Josh [Zestia]> Did anyone follow you recently
[2017-03-24 13:13:29] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I think it is

[2017-03-24 13:13:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> But it's just my opinion
[2017-03-24 13:14:00] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> George, Braden, Fiight

[2017-03-24 14:56:52] <Leon M'laiel> 1 major reason why the PS Vita is superior to the Nintendo Switch:
[2017-03-24 14:56:56] <Leon M'laiel> Pirated games
[2017-03-24 14:56:59] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> yes
[2017-03-24 14:57:05] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And it actually has games [Face with tears of joy]

[2017-03-24 14:57:40] <Leon M'laiel> I do thoooo
[2017-03-24 14:57:41] <BestTube (ZC)> Sometimes, I have to download a pirated game on PC, but not always
[2017-03-24 14:57:49] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Same
[2017-03-24 14:57:58] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I pirated Minecraft >:)
[2017-03-24 14:58:03] <Leon M'laiel> What about the fact you can use a PS4 controller and not the cancerous switch thingies
[2017-03-24 14:58:13] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Hell yes
[2017-03-24 14:58:42] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They thought the Switch was gonna be a modern N64
[2017-03-24 14:58:44] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-24 14:59:34] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Leon can I add Waleed back? He's not hacked anymore.
[2017-03-24 14:59:43] <Leon M'laiel> NES, SNES, GBA('s) and the Wii are the only good things Nintendo made
[2017-03-24 14:59:45] <Leon M'laiel> No you can't
[2017-03-24 14:59:49] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ok.

[2017-03-24 14:59:59] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> nintendo ds was the shit
[2017-03-24 15:00:08] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> PS2 is the real shit
[2017-03-24 15:00:11] <Leon M'laiel> Nintendo DS was good as well tho
[2017-03-24 15:00:15] <Leon M'laiel> But got crushed by the PSP
[2017-03-24 15:00:17] <BestTube (ZC)> Leon I still have my PS1 & PS2
[2017-03-24 15:00:22] <Leon M'laiel> Same
[2017-03-24 15:00:24] <BestTube (ZC)> And they're working [Face with tears of joy][Ok hand sign]
[2017-03-24 15:00:30] <Leon M'laiel> Same
[2017-03-24 15:00:36] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> i have a xbox 360
[2017-03-24 15:00:40] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I had a PS2, until it overheated and the PS2 started to smoke [Face with tears of joy][Face with tears of joy][Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-24 15:01:00] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I used to have an XBOX 360 and I JTAGGED it

[2017-03-24 15:01:11] <BestTube (ZC)> I remember when I played Medal Of Honor for the first time on the PS2 [Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes]
[2017-03-24 15:01:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Fucking money whore Xbox
[2017-03-24 15:01:23] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I played all GTA games on PS2
[2017-03-24 15:01:32] <BestTube (ZC)> XB1 is [Green heart]
[2017-03-24 15:01:35] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Even VC Stories, LC Stories
[2017-03-24 15:01:42] <Leon M'laiel> XB1 is bullshit lmfao
[2017-03-24 15:01:42] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> EWWWW XBOX
[2017-03-24 15:01:51] <Leon M'laiel> The only reason why it's still on the market is the 360 feature
[2017-03-24 15:02:00] <BestTube (ZC)> Naaaah
[2017-03-24 15:02:05] <Leon M'laiel> Kinda sad if you only sell a console because it plays the old generation
[2017-03-24 15:02:08] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They might have backwards compatibility but PS4 will have it soon I swear
[2017-03-24 15:02:12] <BestTube (ZC)> It's waaaaaaaay better than the PS4 imo
[2017-03-24 15:02:14] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yeah
[2017-03-24 15:02:21] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> PS4 can run 4K gaming
[2017-03-24 15:02:31] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Not XBOX nope no no no little boy

[2017-03-24 15:02:34] <Leon M'laiel> How is it better if both resolution, specs and games are a step further on the PS4
[2017-03-24 15:02:38] <Leon M'laiel> 4K gaming on Xbox
[2017-03-24 15:02:40] <Leon M'laiel> Nope
[2017-03-24 15:02:44] <Leon M'laiel> 60fps
[2017-03-24 15:02:45] <Leon M'laiel> Nope
[2017-03-24 15:02:47] <BestTube (ZC)> The new XB1 that will be released his year will DESTROY the PS4
[2017-03-24 15:02:52] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Nope
[2017-03-24 15:02:58] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> pc master race
[2017-03-24 15:03:02] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I highly doubt if
[2017-03-24 15:03:08] <Leon M'laiel> Uhm, no, because the PS4 Pro is already out and has double the specs
[2017-03-24 15:03:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Lmfao
[2017-03-24 15:03:22] <Leon M'laiel> It even supports native 5K
[2017-03-24 15:03:22] <BestTube (ZC)> It has way more features
[2017-03-24 15:03:26] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Does XB1 have 1 TB storage on most of them?
[2017-03-24 15:03:27] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Nope
[2017-03-24 15:03:28] <Leon M'laiel> Like playing 350
[2017-03-24 15:03:32] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> HAHAHHA WALEED TRIES TO CONTACT US
[2017-03-24 15:03:33] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yh
[2017-03-24 15:03:34] <BestTube (ZC)> The PS4 Pro sucks
[2017-03-24 15:03:35] <Leon M'laiel> 360**
[2017-03-24 15:03:37] <Zestia Support> XB1 pretty ok...
[2017-03-24 15:03:39] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> No
[2017-03-24 15:03:55] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Who's on Zestia Support?
[2017-03-24 15:03:58] <Leon M'laiel> No it doesn't lmfao, the PS4 Pro is thinner, has double the specs and a bigger standard HDD
[2017-03-24 15:04:21] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Bruh you aren't going to win the argument PS4 is better than XB1
[2017-03-24 15:04:39] <Leon M'laiel> The XB1 lacks basically any "next-gen" stuff. All it can do is 30 fps and crippling 1080p
[2017-03-24 15:04:50] <Leon M'laiel> LOL EVEN THE PS2 HAD 1080i
[2017-03-24 15:05:00] <Leon M'laiel> Which is almost 1080p
[2017-03-24 15:05:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> And it had backwards compatibility
[2017-03-24 15:05:23] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> But can it run games 2 generations below it?
[2017-03-24 15:05:24] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> NO
[2017-03-24 15:05:33] <Leon M'laiel> So how does it feel to play on a console that barely overthrows a 17 year old console resolution wise
[2017-03-24 15:05:37] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I can play GTA Vice City on my PS4
[2017-03-24 15:05:42] <Leon M'laiel> Same
[2017-03-24 15:05:48] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I wish I had it tbh

[2017-03-24 15:05:59] <Leon M'laiel> And Sony announced PS3 compatibility
[2017-03-24 15:06:04] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> when?
[2017-03-24 15:06:07] <Leon M'laiel> Even with disc games
[2017-03-24 15:06:11] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Oooooo
[2017-03-24 15:06:12] <Leon M'laiel> Read it in a Eurogamer magazine
[2017-03-24 15:06:14] <BestTube (ZC)> The PS4 stole 90% of their features from the XB1
[2017-03-24 15:06:25] <Leon M'laiel> The PS4 was released before the XB1
[2017-03-24 15:06:27] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Stop right there amigo
[2017-03-24 15:06:34] <BestTube (ZC)> In the updates
[2017-03-24 15:06:40] <Leon M'laiel> And most of the features were already there, only redesigned
[2017-03-24 15:06:42] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> ima create a dutch knowkledge test for you guys xd
[2017-03-24 15:06:50] <Leon M'laiel> Or only made available in later patches

[2017-03-24 15:07:06] <BestTube (ZC)> Like the appear offline feature, the XB had it years before and they've just added it this year
[2017-03-24 15:07:13] <Leon M'laiel> Backgrounding for example was introduced later with a better firmware, but was already present in the first
[2017-03-24 15:07:25] <Leon M'laiel> The appear offline feature existed in the PS App
[2017-03-24 15:07:31] <Zestia Support> Giving away this account @ 10 mil followers
[2017-03-24 15:07:31] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yeah
[2017-03-24 15:07:36] <Zestia Support> Jk jk
[2017-03-24 15:07:38] <Leon M'laiel> Sony wanted people to use the App instead which by the way exists since 2010

[2017-03-24 15:09:58] <BestTube (ZC)> It can't be compared to the Kinect at all #lol
[2017-03-24 15:10:02] <Zestia Support> Kinect is racist
[2017-03-24 15:10:05] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Seriously?
[2017-03-24 15:10:13] <Leon M'laiel> Right, because it actually even detects faces
[2017-03-24 15:10:17] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Omfg they only make kids games with Kinect
[2017-03-24 15:10:22] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Just Dance, etc
[2017-03-24 15:10:22] <Leon M'laiel> Kinect is pretty.. barbaric
[2017-03-24 15:10:26] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yh
[2017-03-24 15:10:30] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Compared to Sony
[2017-03-24 15:10:40] <Leon M'laiel> The PS4 lets you even unlock your device with your face
[2017-03-24 15:10:47] <Leon M'laiel> Face recognition since release
[2017-03-24 15:10:51] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Did you see that the newer Xbox is supporting blu-ray?
[2017-03-24 15:10:53] <Leon M'laiel> Something Xbox dreams of
[2017-03-24 15:10:53] <BestTube (ZC)> The XB1 does that
[2017-03-24 15:10:58] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Fucking copycats
[2017-03-24 15:11:04] <Leon M'laiel> XB1 uses DVD's
[2017-03-24 15:11:13] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> The XB1S
[2017-03-24 15:11:17] <Leon M'laiel> Which is kinda sad because the PS1 also did

[2017-03-24 15:12:56] <Leon M'laiel> The best part was faulty voice recognition?
[2017-03-24 15:13:03] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> @KhoujaWaleed
[2017-03-24 15:13:06] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Yeah

[2017-03-24 15:13:42] <Leon M'laiel> Yeah so faulty voice recognition was a plus?
[2017-03-24 15:13:49] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Hell yes
[2017-03-24 15:13:51] <Leon M'laiel> Wow Xbox players are really as retarded as the internet always said
[2017-03-24 15:14:02] <BestTube (ZC)> Nah
[2017-03-24 15:14:09] <Leon M'laiel> I feel bad for you
[2017-03-24 15:14:11] <Waleed Khouja> I am glad I am fucking back
[2017-03-24 15:14:16] <BestTube (ZC)> U r just against the XB1 cuz u didn't even try it
[2017-03-24 15:14:24] <Leon M'laiel> I tried it on gamescom
[2017-03-24 15:14:27] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> The best part is, they had to cancel the XBOX before the XB1 because you could hack the camera that came with it and people can spy on you
[2017-03-24 15:14:35] <Leon M'laiel> The thing about the Xbox one is that it sucks
[2017-03-24 15:14:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Not the 360
[2017-03-24 15:14:38] <Leon M'laiel> That's my problem with it
[2017-03-24 15:14:43] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> yeah
[2017-03-24 15:14:43] <BestTube (ZC)> Nah
[2017-03-24 15:14:47] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> All of them are shit
[2017-03-24 15:14:49] <Leon M'laiel> And the fact they charge so much for a completely sucking console
[2017-03-24 15:14:57] <Leon M'laiel> The only "good" Xbox was the original
[2017-03-24 15:15:02] <BestTube (ZC)> I've both (PS4 & XB1), but I just don't like the PS4
[2017-03-24 15:15:05] <Leon M'laiel> But only because it featured LAN Coop
[2017-03-24 15:15:13] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> If you leave a disc and play it for too long it'll ruin the disc
[2017-03-24 15:15:15] <BestTube (ZC)> It's ugly #lol
[2017-03-24 15:15:26] <Waleed Khouja> Guys I am so sorry for what happened earlier
[2017-03-24 15:15:29] <Leon M'laiel> Yeah you don't like the PS4 for no reason, nobody likes the XB1 because it lacks certain key features
[2017-03-24 15:15:29] <Waleed Khouja> I was hacked
[2017-03-24 15:15:38] <BestTube (ZC)> Leon the XB1 is ~150$ here [Expressionless face]
[2017-03-24 15:15:40] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Makes a ring about an inch from the hole in the middle
[2017-03-24 15:15:47] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Waleed
[2017-03-24 15:15:54] <Waleed Khouja> What?

[2017-03-24 15:16:19] <BestTube (ZC)> Not for no reason, it's the same as the PS3 [Unamused face]
[2017-03-24 15:16:20] <Waleed Khouja> I don't know
[2017-03-24 15:16:26] <Waleed Khouja> What do you want me to do
[2017-03-24 15:16:37] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> He's out permanently
[2017-03-24 15:16:43] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Don't tell him
[2017-03-24 15:16:50] <Waleed Khouja> Ok what happened though?
[2017-03-24 15:16:53] <BestTube (ZC)> Yousef ???
[2017-03-24 15:16:55] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I think he is
[2017-03-24 15:16:55] <Waleed Khouja> Is it because of me?
[2017-03-24 15:16:58] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> No
[2017-03-24 15:17:01] <BestTube (ZC)> Nope
[2017-03-24 15:17:08] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Because he asked dumb questions
[2017-03-24 15:17:24] <Waleed Khouja> I am feeling bad right now [Disappointed face]
[2017-03-24 15:17:24] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Whos out
[2017-03-24 15:17:34] <Waleed Khouja> Youssef I guess
[2017-03-24 15:17:38] <BestTube (ZC)> Not cuz of u waleed
[2017-03-24 15:17:52] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/845353994713272323/845353986211418113/dzpa5Kyq.jpg See
[2017-03-24 15:18:26] <Zestia Support> Youssef was kicked because tbh he only cared about getting his damn UDID signed. This may not be the reason Leon did it but I feel like he only came on to ask about UDID
[2017-03-24 15:18:54] <Waleed Khouja> Things were almost done for me
[2017-03-24 15:19:02] <Leon M'laiel> The XB1 lacks resolution (PS4 @ currently 5K ; XB1 @ currently 1080p), it lacks average FPS (PS1 @ currently ~60 FPS, ~30 FPS in 5K ; XB1 @ 30 FPS in 1080p mode), it lacks titles because Sony temporarily makes them exclusive (lol), the PS4 has 2x the power of the XB1 and uses approx. 50% less energy than the XB1. The XB1 has a huge overheating problem, same goes for the first models of the PS4, the only difference is that Sony fixed it.
[2017-03-24 15:19:05] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Thank god
[2017-03-24 15:19:21] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> So

[2017-03-24 15:19:31] <Leon M'laiel> PS4***
[2017-03-24 15:19:33] <Leon M'laiel> Not PS1
[2017-03-24 15:19:33] <Zestia Support> Damn waleed, couldn't even tag me in your goodbye post [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-24 15:19:50] <Waleed Khouja> lol I tried adding as much as possible
[2017-03-24 15:20:10] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Tagged me :)
[2017-03-24 15:20:19] <BestTube (ZC)> The PS4 Pro has the 4K resolution not the normal PS4
[2017-03-24 15:20:21] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Twitter needs an edit button
[2017-03-24 15:20:39] <Waleed Khouja> The Xbox S doesn't have 4K
[2017-03-24 15:20:49] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> With a small bit of money and skill you can make it have 4K
[2017-03-24 15:20:51] <Leon M'laiel> I am talking average, by the way, PS4 Pro gets 5K with the newest update, the earlier PS4 models 4K support
[2017-03-24 15:20:56] <BestTube (ZC)> And the new XB1 that will come this year will be 6 times faster and stronger than the original one
[2017-03-24 15:20:56] <Waleed Khouja> Overall PS4 is better
[2017-03-24 15:21:03] <Leon M'laiel> Source

[2017-03-24 15:21:20] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Let's see about that
[2017-03-24 15:21:22] <Leon M'laiel> And cost 10.000$?

[2017-03-24 15:23:08] <Leon M'laiel> I don't see any real improvements
[2017-03-24 15:23:26] <Leon M'laiel> I wanna see the super NSA 6 times faster than an i7 console

But I think I came to a point at where I don't do anything for Zestia anymore. I just exist in this chat and piss people off which made me come to the conclusion, carry on. I'll do this then. It was a nice time and I will probably miss that but well, good bye always hurts. So yea...Thanks for what y'all gave me, and see you at some point, Best Regards, The weird anime guy called Tristan [Waving hand sign]
[2017-03-27 04:20:02] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> you never pissed me off [Heavy red heart]

[2017-03-27 04:59:02] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I need your help everyone needs [Slightly frowning face]
[2017-03-27 05:05:29] <Tris-sama> Dude let's be honest. When exactly someone asked me to code something for the last time? And changing ZestiaID to Appsicle doesnt count
[2017-03-27 05:07:15] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I was last night but fall asleep
[2017-03-27 05:07:36] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I know you know php thats why
[2017-03-27 05:09:10] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> Tris, you are active as its needed
[2017-03-27 05:09:45] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> Don't leave,
[2017-03-27 05:09:56] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> I command you not to leave.
[2017-03-27 05:10:13] <Leon M'laiel> You could code a Zestia ticket system [Heavy red heart]
[2017-03-27 05:12:30] <Mirdon Kurteshi> [Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/846288810963062787/846288473376083968/ZsXCq0YY.jpg That time when you only will give installment link and the appstore id of that app, and automatically find everything [Smiling face with smiling eyes]
[2017-03-27 05:13:00] <Leon M'laiel> There are so many things you could code Tristan, we need you [Heavy red heart]
[2017-03-27 05:45:14] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Mirdon what's the point of having all the free apps like yelp? Who is gonna buy Appsicle to get a free app they can get in the AppStore?
[2017-03-27 05:46:09] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> Do people only buy it for one app? Nawwww they buy it mostly for e.g spotify++
[2017-03-27 05:46:19] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> Appsicle is more then one game.
[2017-03-27 05:46:23] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> App*
[2017-03-27 05:46:56] <Christiaan □□ [NL]> Appsicle has different apps, and I believe a own upload store thingy.
[2017-03-27 05:49:49] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Hahahahhahh
[2017-03-27 05:50:13] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Dude it was just to show
[2017-03-27 05:51:29] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I didn't even read what's yelp is
[2017-03-27 06:08:27] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Ahh ok. I thought we were gonna waste space on fucking yelp and other shit.

[2017-03-27 08:34:11] <Leon M'laiel> What business inquiries?
[2017-03-27 08:34:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> He's stealing Tutus plists for zestia
[2017-03-27 08:34:50] <Leon M'laiel> Keep going
[2017-03-27 08:35:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They've been working on it since last night
[2017-03-27 08:35:22] <Leon M'laiel> Proud of y'all
[2017-03-27 08:35:35] <Josh [Zestia]> I didn't do anything[Neutral face]
[2017-03-27 08:35:36] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> They bypassed the security
[2017-03-27 08:35:50] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> So it's our plist now
[2017-03-27 08:35:56] <Leon M'laiel> Let's keep talking in the Council
[2017-03-27 08:35:59] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Ok
[2017-03-27 08:47:51] <BestTube (ZC)> I did somethings Leon [Smiling face with smiling eyes]
[2017-03-27 08:48:01] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> What'd you do
[2017-03-27 08:48:27] <BestTube (ZC)> Won't tell ya, only Mirdon knows [Smirking face][Smiling face with sunglasses]
[2017-03-27 08:48:37] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Boi [Tired face]
[2017-03-27 08:48:46] <BestTube (ZC)> #lol
[2017-03-27 08:50:21] <Josh [Zestia]> Tell me
[2017-03-27 08:50:29] <BestTube (ZC)> Nah
[2017-03-27 08:52:27] <Leon M'laiel> Tell me?
[2017-03-27 08:52:42] <BestTube (ZC)> U don't know ?!?!?! #lol
[2017-03-27 08:52:46] <Leon M'laiel> Nah
[2017-03-27 08:52:56] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Why we dont create zestia Json
[2017-03-27 08:53:06] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I think is better
[2017-03-27 08:53:12] <BestTube (ZC)> It's about the jsons Leon [Winking face]
[2017-03-27 08:53:14] <Leon M'laiel> Because it's easier this way
[2017-03-27 08:53:30] <Leon M'laiel> You have to think of PLIST's like modules
[2017-03-27 08:53:40] <Leon M'laiel> If one is faulty you can simply repair it or replace it
[2017-03-27 08:53:52] <Leon M'laiel> A JSON is like a motherboard you first had to get hold on to replace things
[2017-03-27 08:54:00] <Leon M'laiel> Have*
[2017-03-27 08:54:14] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I think json is much easier to work
[2017-03-27 08:54:19] <Mirdon Kurteshi> In appsicle
[2017-03-27 08:54:19] <BestTube (ZC)> I got the vshare jsons (1240+ jsons) [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-27 08:54:19] <Leon M'laiel> And this way I think it's just easier and there's more of an overview
[2017-03-27 08:54:24] <Mirdon Kurteshi> We have a lot of updates
[2017-03-27 08:54:27] <Mirdon Kurteshi> A lot of apps
[2017-03-27 08:54:36] <Mirdon Kurteshi> We need those generator
[2017-03-27 08:54:40] <Leon M'laiel> You got links?
[2017-03-27 08:54:56] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I think when we use json
[2017-03-27 08:55:03] <BestTube (ZC)> Yep, got the links of their jsons
[2017-03-27 08:55:05] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I can create one for news
[2017-03-27 08:55:08] <Mirdon Kurteshi> For tweaks
[2017-03-27 08:55:19] <Leon M'laiel> Mind to share one? [Smiling face]
[2017-03-27 08:55:32] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Entity share that PDF
[2017-03-27 08:55:52] <Leon M'laiel> TF am I supposed to do with a PDF
[2017-03-27 08:56:08] <BestTube (ZC)> Okay, it has the links Leon
[2017-03-27 08:56:09] <Leon M'laiel> what would I need a PDF for
[2017-03-27 08:56:20] <BestTube (ZC)> I can't write down 1240+ links #lol

[2017-03-27 08:57:02] <Leon M'laiel> Council

[2017-03-27 09:40:14] <Leon M'laiel> Nah
[2017-03-27 09:40:17] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> If he's doing a giveaway, then he gets the money himself
[2017-03-27 09:40:28] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I wouldn't of let him in anyways
[2017-03-27 09:40:31] <Leon M'laiel> I don't want him to join

[2017-03-29 16:14:22] <BestTube (ZC)> It's a money anti cheat
[2017-03-29 16:15:12] <BestTube (ZC)> Checks if the value stored for the money has been changed to a high value in a small time, it's a very simple one
[2017-03-29 16:16:32] <BestTube (ZC)> I made a trucks' company system too, u can't find it anywhere in the internet, it's so rare and I saw only 1 server has a similar one [Winking face]

[2017-03-29 16:18:50] <BestTube (ZC)> I'll send u the anti cheat system, the company system is inside a game mode script so it's not in a separated file
[2017-03-29 16:21:21] <Mirdon Kurteshi> I have tried but wasn't having time today, i leaved everything tomorrow

[2017-03-29 19:37:26] <BestTube (ZC)> And iOSHQ, I don't know the link, sry
[2017-03-29 21:58:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> I have a legit "what would you do" problem
[2017-03-29 21:58:38] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> What is it
[2017-03-29 21:59:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> Well...okay. So I know this girl. Her name is Lizzy. Me and her have been friends since we were babies. So have our parents.
[2017-03-29 22:05:26] <Rhett [Zestia]> So..at the end of last year she started dating this guy. He's popular, everyone likes him. He seems like an alright guy. So since her parents are friends with mine they say a lot of stuff and I hear it. He is 100% crazy. He doesn't let her go with her parents to places, meets them where ever they are. Show up at their house and just walk in. She's only 15, he's 17. She has been forced to drop all her friends including me since he is crazy. She is completely brainwashed in his thing and doesn't realize he's crazy. Everyone knows it, everyone notices and talks about it, but she doesn't care. Her mom is not doing anything, but I'm really worried about her even though she completely has dropped all her friends. He deleted all her friends out of her phone and she didn't even have my contact when I texted her last. She has 100% changed and she turned to a snobby, rude girl in the matter of a year. He is abusive mentally and pushes her and is always touching her. He always laughs when he does it but he is crazy and is seeing her limits. He makes her hate herself, and always says stuff over text to make her worried about him..I just don't know what to do. I told her she is gonna end up being killed, she doesn't care, she doesn't even realize what's happening.
[2017-03-29 22:06:23] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Bro
[2017-03-29 22:06:31] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Dm me your number let's text

[2017-03-29 22:07:39] <Rhett [Zestia]> But I don't want to text about it, people look at my phone
[2017-03-29 22:08:41] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> It's ok
[2017-03-29 22:08:46] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I'll text a bit later
[2017-03-29 22:09:09] <Rhett [Zestia]> Nah, my parents I mean. They have iCloud and check it
[2017-03-29 22:09:15] <Rhett [Zestia]> Just talk here
[2017-03-29 22:09:18] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Ooooo
[2017-03-29 22:09:27] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Aight
[2017-03-29 22:09:28] <Rhett [Zestia]> What should I do...
[2017-03-29 22:09:37] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> tell someone like the police
[2017-03-29 22:10:02] <Rhett [Zestia]> No, she's happy, she doesn't understand though
[2017-03-29 22:10:13] <Rhett [Zestia]> He hasn't actually done physical abuse yet
[2017-03-29 22:10:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> That I know of
[2017-03-29 22:10:31] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> well
[2017-03-29 22:10:41] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> you and that group should talk to her
[2017-03-29 22:10:49] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Group of friends that she left
[2017-03-29 22:11:10] <Rhett [Zestia]> We all have, even the friends parents have. Everyone knows about it
[2017-03-29 22:11:38] <Rhett [Zestia]> I fr think she's gonna end up dead
[2017-03-29 22:11:48] <Rhett [Zestia]> He's insane. Honestly crazy
[2017-03-29 22:12:51] <Rhett [Zestia]> And I'll be honest, I liked her sorta, but not anymore. She dropped me, but I still feel like the closest think to a brother she had, I can't just let this go. She's changed so much
[2017-03-29 22:14:00] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Wow
[2017-03-29 22:14:03] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> bro
[2017-03-29 22:14:14] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> If it's this bad I think she's long gone...
[2017-03-29 22:14:17] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> I'm sorry bro
[2017-03-29 22:15:44] <Rhett [Zestia]> I think so too honestly, even her mom does
[2017-03-29 22:16:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> She use to do cheer, volleyball, be a friend, go to church. Now she just has him
[2017-03-29 22:17:05] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Wow
[2017-03-29 22:17:16] <Rhett [Zestia]> It honestly sounds like the opening to a murder episode on tv. They say everyone knew about it and didn't do shit. She's gonna end up dead and it's gonna be my fault
[2017-03-29 22:17:22] <Rhett [Zestia]> I could have stopped it
[2017-03-29 22:17:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> But, he is bigger than me. He could kill me. I have no chance against him.
[2017-03-29 22:18:05] <Rhett [Zestia]> If he does anything to her I'm gonna talk to him though
[2017-03-29 22:19:32] <Rhett [Zestia]> It's been bothering me for months
[2017-03-29 22:20:44] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> Don't blame yourself
[2017-03-29 22:21:52] <Rhett [Zestia]> Nah, it's completely her fault. She's brainwashed, but if something happens I could have done something
[2017-03-29 22:25:18] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> NO
[2017-03-29 22:25:30] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> you had no choice. He is bigger
[2017-03-29 22:26:03] <Rhett [Zestia]> There is a choice [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-03-29 22:26:12] <iOSHQ [Zestia Team]> you owuldnt have a chance tbh, and i dont want my buddy ton get hurt defending a girl. Just let her realise that hes a dickwad
[2017-03-29 22:26:35] <Rhett [Zestia]> I did. I expected that like 4 months ago. She isn't.

[2017-03-31 06:04:14] <Leon M'laiel> I don't think anyone's PS4 is still on that

[2017-04-01 19:19:56] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> All apps I've uploaded to Zestia all require tutu because nobody else signs them
[2017-04-01 19:20:03] <BestTube (ZC)> Yeah but other apps r important too

[2017-04-03 18:31:28] <BestTube (ZC)> Unless u reverse it with either IDA or Hopper (which is very hard to do)
[2017-04-03 18:33:27] <Mirdon Kurteshi> Hëmmm
[2017-04-03 18:33:39] <Mirdon Kurteshi> That's the case

[2017-04-04 15:07:38] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Booiiiii
[2017-04-04 15:08:04] <Rhett [Zestia]> And they were being tracked like 20 minutes after taking off and ATC put out an emergency broadcast right before the others were taken over [Face with tears of joy]
[2017-04-04 15:08:20] <Rhett [Zestia]> Jets were scrambled within like 25-30 mins
[2017-04-04 15:08:48] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> 25 minutes is the flight time from Boston to NY. Too late at that point...
[2017-04-04 15:09:04] <Rhett [Zestia]> Idk the time but it happened
[2017-04-04 15:09:15] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> One second
[2017-04-04 15:09:50] <Rhett [Zestia]> Standing orders on September 11 dictated that, upon receiving a request for assistance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) would normally order escort aircraft to approach and follow an aircraft that was confirmed to be hijacked in order to assure positive flight following, report unusual observances, and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency.[1] The 9/11 Commission determined that on the morning of September 11, the FAA deliberately did not adequately notify NORAD of the hijackings of Flights 11, 77, 93, or 175 in time for escort aircraft to reach the hijacked flights.[2] Notification of the hijacking of Flight 11 prompted the scrambling of two fighter jets from Otis Air National Guard Base, but they were not in the air until after Flight 11 had hit the North Tower. An erroneous FAA report of a hijacked plane heading towards Washington ("phantom Flight 11") prompted the scrambling of three more fighters from the 1st Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base, which due to "poor communications", ended up flying eastward, out to sea, instead of heading toward Washington, significantly delaying their arrival on the scene.[2]
[2017-04-04 15:09:54] <Rhett [Zestia]> One hit frat
[2017-04-04 15:09:57] <Rhett [Zestia]> *first

[2017-04-04 15:12:17] <Rhett [Zestia]> I remember watching it in AIr crash investigation. FAA didn't even know what to do so they directly called the Air Force
[2017-04-04 15:12:18] <Dylan [Zestia Team]> Aye fag listen up. Just read up. They didn't realize what was happening with the first plane and no planes were sent until it hit. After it was hit, it was too late to stop the second as it was already there
[2017-04-04 15:12:41] <Mazen> Hey
[2017-04-04 15:12:43] <Rhett [Zestia]> Yea bish. They were scrambled after the first
